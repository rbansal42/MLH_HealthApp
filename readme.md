## Inspiration
A live stream inspired me
## What it does
It counts steps
## How we built it
With Blood, Sweats, and tears
## Challenges we ran into
- Setting up Android Studio is really hard. Like really really hard.
- There was this time of about 3 hours when the app didn't count steps because apparently, you have to give it permission to access data or whatever. 
- Pff! Consent is for noobs (Jk).
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Well, it ***works!***
## What we learned
Android Studio can convert Java code to Kotlin automatically. The ***dopest*** thing to see in action!
## What's next for Health App
Maybe a dialog box that asks for permission because consent is necessary...
